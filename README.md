# Dotfiles and Bash Settings/Functions

Configuration files used on Debian, I have been using Vim, TMUX and bash quite a bit. 
This will help for when I inevitably break things again.

Running the file "autobashrc" will add all of these files to
the local environment. Just need to restart the terminal
session and they should be all ready to go
