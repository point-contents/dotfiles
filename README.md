# Dotfiles and Bash Settings/Functions

Configuration files so that I can keep my familiar tools. 
This will help for when I inevitably break things again.

Running the file "autobashrc" will add all of these files to
the local environment. Just need to restart the terminal
session and they should be all ready to go.

Pretty hacky way of doing it though, there must be some better way.
