# Dotfiles and Bash Settings/Functions

Configuration files, I have been using Vim, TMUX and bash quite a bit lately.
This will help for when I inevitably break things again.

Running the file "autobashrc" will add all of these files to
the local environment. Just need to restart the terminal
session and they should be all ready to go.

Pretty hacky way of doing it though, there must be some better way to get it done
